Mitsumi m25sp-5n Unipolar Step Sequence
White:Orange:Red:Blue

This motor came from Jameco.
There is a tiny circuit board on the motor that you can cut the trace to power this with a bipolar driver. 

Notes to ordering better steppers:
Order bipolar wired motors
The 2 hole flange is much better for changing out motors, then the 370/385 DC motor style. 
These have a 5mm shaft. 8-10mm would be better. 
Have 4 stripped & tinned wires soldered on with assorted lengths.

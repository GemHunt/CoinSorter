This conveyor design is mostly for scanning. It's also to test out sorting. I have come to the conclusion that until conveyors are being build for sorting I don't know what they should look like. Initially scanning to learn how this all works is much different than deploying a conveyor to sort. 

The basic hardware of the conveyor is in the conveyors repo:https://github.com/GemHunt/conveyors

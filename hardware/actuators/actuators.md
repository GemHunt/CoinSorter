Proof of Concept Actuator

Rotary Flapper Solenoid:
A USPS surplus RAM MFG CO ROTARY SOLENOID ACTUATOR part 40R10102

This is too big and I don't recommend it. 

What should be used?

A solenoid certainly seems the most logical.

Such as low cost push solenoids to knock coins off the belt:
5mm travel?
Maybe some type of foot it's more then just the rod end, but try without a foot first.

Rotary solenoids seems like a good idea, but I have not seen many.

If you position you could sort to more than one bin:
RC servos since they are so common and easy to control. 
Cheap stepper motors might not be a bad idea. A step past a rotary solenoid.

# CoinSorter

Sorts coins by solenoid on a conveyor by classifying images with [Caffe](https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe) &amp;  [DIGITS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS)

To understand where this system is heading in the short term see the [prototype CoinSorter's issues](
https://github.com/GemHunt/CoinSorter/milestones/Prototype%20CoinSorter).

This group of programs and scripts is currently just a quick proof of concept to show physical coin sorting. It's currently sorting about 2 pennies a second, continuously. One solenoid and 2 physical bins are currently set up. Using Caffe itâ€™s easy to distinguish between designs of coins. For example you can train a convolutional neural network (CNN, what Caffe uses) to determine if a coin image is heads vs tails or say recognize the state on a random US state quarter image. Using the "copper" image set out on [GemHunt.com](http://www.gemHunt.com) Caffe can tell heads vs tails between US copper pennies 99.9% of the time. This can be done using using [DIGITS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS) with default setting of AlexNet with no programming involved!

#CoinSorter Project:
* This program watches a directory for images to appear
* The image is sent to DIGITS (The Nivida Caffe front end) for classification
* Finally a solenoid turns on for coins that meet a certain criteria

#CanonSDKTutorial-noexe:
* Saves image captures to file and calls a MATLAB script to crop the coins to 256x256 images
